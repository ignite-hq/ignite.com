/*
  CUSTOM MEDIA QUERIES
  Inspired by Bootstrap 5.0 - https://v5.getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/layout/breakpoints/
  Media query values can be changed to fit your own content.
  There are no magic bullets when it comes to media query width values.
  They should be declared in px units - and they should be set to meet
  the needs of your content. You can also add additional media queries,
  or remove some of the existing ones.
  These media queries can be referenced like so:
  @media $breakpoint-medium {
    .medium-and-larger-specific-style {
      background-color: red;
    }
  }
  @media $breakpoint-medium-only {
    .medium-screen-specific-style {
      background-color: red;
    }
  }
  @media $breakpoint-large {
    .large-and-larger-screen-specific-style {
      background-color: red;
    }
  }
*/

@use "sass:map";

/* Responsive breakpoints */
$breakpoints: (
  xs: 0,
  sm: 576px,
  md: 768px,
  lg: 992px,
  xl: 1200px,
  xxl: 1400px,
  xxxl: 1900px
);
