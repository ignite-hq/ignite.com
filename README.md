## Generated code

The two packages, `tendermint-spn-ts-client` and `tendermint-spn-vue`, inside `src/generated` were generated by Ignite CLI on top of Ignite Network chain.

### To make use of the Vue Api, do =

```ts
import { useTendermintFundraisingModule } from 'tendermint-spn-vue'

const { queryActions } = useTendermintFundraisingModule({
  ignite: ignite.value
})
```

### To get the `igniteClient` instance, do =

```ts
import { useIgnite } from 'tendermint-spn-ts-client'

const {
  state: { ignite }
} = useIgnite()
```

## 🏗 WIP

The generated code is on early alpha. This means a bunch of minor and couple of major issues are yet to be solved.
